<h1>Thomas Soden <h1>
<h2>Historian of Twentieth Century British and German Diplomatic History <h2>


<body>
<p>My name is Tom, and I am about to complete my PhD at the European University Institute, Florence. 
Aside from my academic history, I have a few other interests and projects relating to music, beer (homebrew and the history and culture of) writing and drawing.
This is hopefully the first very preliminary version of my personal website, which will be completed soon if I can a) actually pass my viva and b) get my act together with docker.</p>
<p> I also maintain a long-running blog at <a href="pastvergangenheit.wordpress.com">Next Page</a> </p>
